Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players,
X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing
three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. This project is attempting to simulate tic tac toe UI and logic using Angular and other tools. **See more below**.
